    "# SD_Study Data Files Scanner and Analyzer\n",
    "In the drug registration process, SD files (short for Study Data files) refer to electronic data submissions that contain structured datasets from nonclinical and clinical studies. These datasets are prepared following standardized data models to allow regulatory agencies (like the FDA, EMA, or local authorities) to efficiently review, validate, and analyze the study results.\n",

    "**SD files** = Study Data Files — electronic data packages containing the raw and tabulated data from:\n",
    "**Nonclinical studies** (toxicology, pharmacology)\n",
    "**Clinical studies** (efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### CDISC standards\n",
    "- SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model) – standardized structure for tabulated data.\n",
    "- ADaM (Analysis Data Model) – datasets used for statistical analysis.\n",
    "- SEND (Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data) – for preclinical (animal) data.\n",

    "This notebook scans the current directory for files and analyzes specific file types using appropriate libraries:\n",
    "- **.sdf files**:  Structure Data File (Chemoinformatics) Plain text molecular data format used to store 3D structures, bonds, properties, and metadata - RDKit for chemical structure analysis\n",
    "- **.xpt files**: SAS XPORT (SDTM Clinical Datasets) Contains clinical study data such as Demographics (DM), Adverse Events (AE), and Laboratory Results (LB) - pyreadstat for SAS transport files\n",
